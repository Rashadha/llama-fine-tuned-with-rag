# Fine-Tuning LLaMA with RAG

## Description
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLaMA model using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It leverages PyTorch and various optimization techniques to enhance model performance for NLP tasks.

## Installation
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets bitsandbytes accelerate peft trl xformers
```

For Colab users, additional installations may be required:

```bash
pip install "unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
```

Depending on the GPU type, install:

- For newer GPUs (RTX 30xx, RTX 40xx, A100, H100, L40):
  ```bash
  pip install --no-deps packaging ninja einops flash-attn xformers trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes
  ```
- For older GPUs (V100, Tesla T4, RTX 20xx):
  ```bash
  pip install --no-deps xformers trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes
  ```

## Usage
Run the notebook sequentially to fine-tune the model:

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and configure the environment.
2. **Load Dataset**: Load and preprocess training data.
3. **Model Training**: Train the LLaMA model with RAG.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance on test data.

```

## Configuration
Modify hyperparameters in the notebook to adjust training settings such as batch size, learning rate, and training epochs.

## Results
After training, the model can be evaluated using test datasets to measure its accuracy and performance.
